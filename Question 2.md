	1) Type:  Puzzle based game or 1st person adventure.
	A puzzle based game is better to keep the subject it to the point, for recognizing patterns and helping students develop their deduction  skills . 
	While a 1st person adventure will be very difficult to keep the game exactly in to the subject it will be a more fun experience for the students   
	2) Console: gaming consoles, laptops or mobile phones 
	A gaming console or a laptop would be better for creating a better game with better gameplay and better graphics because the systems are stronger
	and they can support more (virtual reality etc) but not necessary everyone will have a gaming console. In the contrary mobile phones cant support
	the same power but every one have acces to one
	3) Single or Multiplayer 
	It is always better to learn with friends and it will be more competitive giving to the students one more reason to try harder but recent 
	polls have shown that most people prefer single player games (polls at the end of the page)
	4)  Competitive or Collaborative 
	As mentioned before a competitive environment would give the students a boost because they would try harder because no one wants 
	to lose but a collaborative environment would also help students to develop theirs social skills and to become better at working as a team
	5) High score
	We need to clarify if our game will have a global high score. These will also give a reason to the student to try harder because everyone 
	wants to be at the top but it might discourage students that are not going so well and they are at the bottom of the high score  
	6) Online 
	Online would surely make the game more interesting and could help to make it ether more competitive or collaborative(depending on what we choose) 
	but it would take a lot of time to develop and it is not certain that it will help in the learning aspect
	7) Straight forward story or with brunches (the player choose what will happen)
	A straight forward story would be easier to develop and it will be more in  to the point for the learning 
	experience(cause we dictate how the story unfolds). A story with brunches it would make the game more appealing to the students 
	8) Short game or long game
	A short game can focus to the most important aspects of the subject and the students can play the game several times until they 
	fill comfortable about their knowledge, on the other hand a long game can include more aspects of the subject and dedicate a small part 
	in revising the things that the student learned        
	9) Different levels
	A possibility for different levels would give the chance for students that are advance in that course to skip the "easy parts". 
	However it may create a difference in levels among students (some of them are to far ahead and some of them are to far behind)
	10) If it should include some of the information in the readings or it should include puzzles which need to be solved by reading them
	By having puzzles that they need to know the information on the reading  means that the students will be forced to know that information.
	These could have two possible outcomes
	ether the students are going to find that information or they are going to leave the game because the may find it 
	boring(cause they donâ€™t know some of the necessary 	stuff or the stuck on a level). On the other hand if it includes information form 
	the readings could help student get familiar with that knowledge and provoke them to study more on that subject from the actual readings
