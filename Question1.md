In requirement engineering, elicitation and analysis involves with system users, customers and developers as it discovers the requirements of the system. Requirements rely on the needs of customers for a system that be in the service of a purpose. In this problem, the main purpose is encouraging students to read about the history of the Atlantic. Thus, requirements are based on history teachersâ€™ needs. History teachers may have a direct or indirect influence on the system requirements. They are the one of end user who will use the system and they have the control on the system over students. During the gathering process of requirements, as the first step, system developers will interact with teachers and the history departments to obtain their requirements that they wanted to have in the system and will compare with the current system. This discussion will be based on interviews and observations. Moreover, developers will have gather some information from students as well in order to see their preferences such as what kind of puzzles they like to play. This stage called as Requirement Discovery in the requirements elicitation and analysis process (Sommerville, 2011).
