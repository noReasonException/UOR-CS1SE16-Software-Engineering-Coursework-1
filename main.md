The following report is about developing a plan in order to create a set of requirements and constraints for our clients .Our final goal is to create an educational
video game based on history lessons provided by a set of teachers.
In the following paragraphs our team will analyse and create an 'action' plan . This plan will be used as guidance in the requirements specification, after the specification
our requirements will be ready to be given to our team of developers/programmers. This plan includes a list of possible choices our customer has ,
as well as an mini-analyse of every potential problems/opportunities each choice has.
##  Abstract


This report is about the way our team will gather the needed information , in order to create a well-defined plan of requirements. 
The report describes in fine detail the approach of gathering information from the client ,analyzing the possible choices and ensuring that the project
will create a viable product that reflects exactly the customer’s needs , as well as that the project will be maintained correctly for the years to come , 
trying to leave as little gaps as possible on our planning.

#### Background:
In order to be able to understand fully the contents of this report , we need to know the following definitions

    1. Dependency over Constraints : With the word dependency we mean a 
        logical connection between two requirements such that without the details 
        of one it is impossible to specify the other.
    2. Elicitation of requirements : By the term elicitation we mean 
        the user requirements discovery procedure , via the classical methods of 
        interviewing the client or study relevant products
    3. first person game : 1rst person game is a sub-category of games 
        that the actual gameplay is projected through the eyes of the main character, 
        further info exists on apendix section in the end of this report.
    4. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new act of the 
        european union more info can be found in appendix section.
    
With these definitions in mind , we can proceed and understand every part of the following document.

#### Objective:
Our final goal is to create a plan of gathering a set of requirements and possible constraints from the client. 
Our team will have this report as plan in order to start the actual gathering procedure by approaching the clients in a structured way.

#### Methods:
The following report is a Case-Study of the possible choices that our clients have available. 
We structure our report in an argument-oriented way in order to help our team of experts in the gathering requirements procedure,
to present the clients available choices in a easy and understandable way

#### Results:
The results of our report is a simple and elegant plan of the way we will approach the requirements gathering , 
by having a list of possible choices , the facts and possible outcomes of these choices , as well as the correct ordering of the 
points witch need clarification first in order to produce a correct list of requirements


##  Who should you be asking about the requirements? 
The requirement needed about the game should be mostly discussed with the customer. Requirements rely on the needs of customers for a system that will be in the service of a purpose. In this problem, the main purpose is encouraging students to read about the history of the Atlantic. Thus, requirements about the game are based on history teachers’ needs. Their requirements are going to help us figure out what must be done to solve the problem.  History teachers as well as the actual students may have a direct or indirect influence on the game requirements. The game will be mostly played by students, so it is important to have their vision about their ideal game. 

The first step during the gathering process of requirements is for the game developers to interact with teachers and the history departments to obtain their needs, discuss what they want in the game and compare with other similar games. This discussion will be based on interviews, focus groups, process reviews and observation of existing games as well as on leading research on educational games and their affect on the learning process. . All these useful methods of gathering requirements will allow us to provide a well-rounded understanding of user requirements. This stage called as Requirement Discovery in the requirements elicitation and analysis process (Sommerville, 2011). 

In addition, later we need to categorise the final requirements according to Ian Sommerville. There are two type of requirements, ‘user’ and ‘system ‘requirements. Ian Sommerville defines that user requirements specify the expectations of customers from the system. The user requirements for a system describe the functional and non-functional requirements as they should be understandable for users, such as teachers and students who may not have technical knowledge. On the other hand, system requirements include the detailed descriptions of the system functions and services. Nonetheless, user requirements are described as an introduction to the system requirements.  As mention before, students and mainly teachers will define the requirements in detail to developers and testers and then in order to avoid restrictive design decisions, information about predicted changes can help system designers. Finally, that information about requirements will help system maintenance engineers to apply new requirements to the game.(Inflectra Corporation, 2018).


##  What points do you need to clarify?
#### Type:  Puzzle based game or 1st person adventure
A puzzle based game is better to keep the subject to the point, for recognizing patterns and helping students develop their deduction  skills . 
While a 1st person adventure will be very difficult to keep the game exactly in to the subject, it will be a more fun experience for the students   
#### Console: gaming consoles, laptops or mobile phones 
A gaming console or a laptop would be better for creating a better game with better gameplay and better graphics because the systems are stronger
and they can support more (virtual reality etc) but not necessary everyone will have a gaming console. In the contrary mobile phones cant support
the same amount of power but every one have acces to one
#### Single or Multiplayer: 
It is always better to learn with friends and it will be more competitive giving to the students one more reason to try harder but recent 
polls have shown that most people prefer single player games (polls at the end of the page)
#### Competitive or Collaborative:
As mentioned before a competitive environment would give the students a boost because they would try harder, no one wants 
to lose, but a collaborative environment would also help students to develop theirs social skills and to become better at working as a team
#### High score:
We need to clarify if our game will have a global high score. These will also give a reason to the student to try harder because everyone 
wants to be at the top but it might discourage students that are not going so well and they are at the bottom of the high score  
#### Online:
Online would surely make the game more interesting and could help to make it ether more competitive or collaborative(depending on what we choose) 
but it would take a lot of time to develop and it is not certain that it will help in the learning aspect
#### Straight forward story or with brunches (the player choose what will happen):
A straight forward story would be easier to develop and it will be more in  to the point for the learning 
experience(cause we dictate how the story unfolds). A story with brunches it would make the game more appealing to the students 
#### Short game or long game:
A short game can focus to the most important aspects of the subject and the students can play the game several times until they 
fill comfortable about their knowledge, on the other hand a long game can include more aspects of the subject and dedicate a small part 
in revising the things that the student learned        
#### Different levels:
A possibility for different levels would give the chance for students that are advance in that course to skip the "easy parts". 
However it may create a difference in levels among students (some of them are to far ahead and some of them are to far behind)
#### If it should include some of the information in the readings or it should include puzzles which need to be solved by reading them:
By having puzzles that they need to know the information on the reading  means that the students will be forced to know that information.
These could have two possible outcomes
either the students are going to find that information or they are going to leave the game because the may find it 
boring(cause they don’t know some of the necessary    stuff or the stuck on a level). On the other hand if it includes information form 
the readings could help student get familiar with that knowledge and provoke them to study more on that subject from the actual readings 


## User and System requirements




##  What constraints might there be?

During the creation of the game there were some main constrains. Some of which were legal and some of which were technical constrains. The technical constrains where if the game was going to be online or offline and the testing of the game. The legal constrains where copyright, open or closed source and maintenance. Both categories are described in depth bellow.
#### Legal Constrains:

One of the constraints is copyright, a law that protects the computer code used in games, music, videos and many more. It is made sure by the team that the music, images and videos used in the game are not against the copyright law which requires the permission of the copyright owner to use their product.  Also, in order to protect the game, the user is not allowed to copy anything from the actual game because it is against the copyright law.

Moreover, we had to figure out if the game would be an open source that will allow the public to make some kind of changes to the game and produce games with a similar idea, or if it will be a closed source which means that it will be a game strictly available only to the user. Whichever of the two is chosen there is still a cost to both, open source software is “free” (free from restrictions).  Having an open source, or a closed source will need maintaining and will cost money which means due to that the game will have to be profitable. 

In addition, maintenance is also a constrain. Maintaining a game is not easy. We have to make sure that the quality and efficiency of the game are improved and that the failures are reduced without spending a lot of money on it. By having a small in size game, it will prevent extra cost, since the smaller the game the less money needed in order to maintain it, and also it will be easier for the game to load as fast as possible due to the game’s size. Furthermore, we had to keep in mind that whatever was maintained even at its best the game will still have bugs and failures in it.
#### Technical Constrains:

Another constrains faced was if the game will be an offline game which means that the user does not have to worry about the server shutting down, or if it will be an online game that needs a good internet connection in order to function correctly.

Likewise, testing is the most important part to a game. There are up to nine different testing techniques that can be used in order to make sure that the game is ready. Through testing we had to ensure that the quality and performance of the game is good enough for it to be available to users. Testing had to be done in order to identify any bugs that could prevent the user from having the best possible experience using the game. In addition, it is used to test out that all of the game parts are functioning correctly. Lastly, we had to test that the game is able to handle a lot of users using the game at the same time. 



##  Whitch points need clarification first?

It is obvious that many requirements maintain a depedency over other requirements , and is impossible to specify them if we do not specify their depedencies first .
#### What we mean with the word “dependency”?
With the word dependency we mean a logical connection between two requirements such that without the details of one it is impossible to specify the other.

#### Constraint Dependencies:
As the analysis progresses , a dependency diagram will be created to reflect the actual needs of the customer. 
As previously sad in Question 3 , There are some constraints that need to disquiss with our client, in a nutshell , the main parts of the Question 3 are
    1. Legal Constraints (Copyright Issues,Legal issues,Data issues,Ownership issues,Profit policy)
    2. Technical Constraints(Testing,Speed constraints ,Network constraints,Source code distribution policy(Open source vs Closed Source),Maintenance issues)
We will analyze the Legal Constraints in paragraph 4.2.1 and Technical Constraints in paragraph 4.2.2, although there are some unavoidable collisions between them .

#### Legal Constraints: 
it is obvious that some legal constraints  maintain a dependency relation , the initial diagram follows…

![Diagram No1](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/SoftwareEngineering_2018-19/Group-1/coursework1/raw/72480f36d4342ae9c919e088abbf8b6ddcf223c6/que4/A.png)

#### Copyright Constraints:
Before we proceed with the rest of the chapter , we need to strictly define 
the term *data* . What we define as data?

We can define as data the following

    1. The main character dialogs
    2. The Story description
    3. Even the title of the game
    4. Also and potentially sensitive data(on the users accounts) 
    
*This data needs to be copyright-free and well protected as required by law.*

The first dependency we need to examine is the Copyright constraint . 
In order to be able to specify the constraint on Copyright , at first we need to point the person/organization where our final product will belong to. 
It will be the teacher?the university the teacher works? The Association of Universities? 
So it becomes clear that we need to specify the Ownership of the final product in order to specify copyright issues.

Secondly, in order to specify the Copyright , it is essential to make clear what profit policy we have . 
It will be a paid game? It will be free to all students? It will be free to anyone? .So we can say that there is a strong logical relationship of 
the profit policy and the copyright issues.

Thirdly , we can associate the source code distribution policy with copyright issues . 
This is a very strong relationship , because a decision of different source code distribution may affect the whole body of the copyright notice.
Additionally , we need to be very careful with the context of the game , something that is not a constraint but a requirement and will be further analysed later . 
We refer it here because the copyright is a constraint rather a requirement . So we need to explicitly explain why we need to take care the context when we 
creating the copyright notice. Because the game is about history may someone claim that the context of their history book are stolen .
We need carefully study the facts of the history and remain context-neutral of any of our sources.

This Context→Copyright issues can be extended further into , and include and the Data→Copyright issues . What data we store in our game? 
It is copyrighted data? We need to protect our data?

Lastly , we need to consider what is Legal and what not. For example the new europe’s GDPR Act place constraints on data we can save 
(for example , in high score table) and enforces strict security policies on them . 
There is a deep relationship between the Legal Constraints and the Data/Context/Security constraints , the following diagram make it clear


![Diagram No2](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/SoftwareEngineering_2018-19/Group-1/coursework1/raw/936afb04aa75cd89352a8d3bc8cd97e06eeaf02f/que4/B.png)


#### Introducing levels:
The levels existing in the diagram serves a very simple purpose. Every constraint on level n needs to be clarified after Level n-1 . 
The order of clarification in each order doesn't matter. Notice that is the safe way and provides a guidance to start decompose our requirements/constraints.

#### Maintenance constraints:
The maintenance issues is far less dependent on other constraints than the copyright issues.
Firstly , we need to have the Source Code Distribution Policy in order to specify the maintenance issues! 
Will our privately-funded team maintain the code(closed source scenario) or the maintenance will lead by the open source community?(Open source scenario).

Secondly , the we need to clarify first the context issues in order to be able to specify the maintenance issues in conjunction with the Source Code Distribution Policy .
Will  the privately-funded team of historians continue to support the context of the game (closes source policy) 
or the development of context will finally lead by the open-source community(open source policy)?
Lastly , we need to consider the profit policy in order to solve all maintenance issues. 
If the policy is non-profit and in the same time closed source , how our team of experts will paid?
There is any discussion about paid maintenance in this point?
By discovering these connections our diagram will transformed as follows…

![Diagram No3](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/SoftwareEngineering_2018-19/Group-1/coursework1/raw/faa9d31a6e5d7e13270780b7fcabaf31b8b982b3/que4/C.png)

Now our diagram makes clear what constraints need clarification first. The order follows…

    1. Level 1
        1. Security Constraints
        2. Context Requirements
        3. Data Requirements
        4. Speed Constraints
    2. Level 2
        1. Legal Constraints
        2. Source Code Distribution Policy
        3. Ownership issues
        4. Profit Policy
    3. Level 3
        1. Copyright
        2. Maintenance Constraints
        
    
#### Technical Constraints:
As previously said on question 3 , there are a number of technical constraints , 
such as testing,speed constraints ,network constraints,source code distribution policy as well as maintenance issues.
We can distinguish a number of dependencies , which will explained in the rest of the chapter.

At first , we need to make clear all the speed constraints in order to clarify the network constraints. 
If for example the speed constraints said that everything should load under 1 second then may we need to drop every plan 
for online gaming(So forget everything has to do with network constraints.).

Secondly , we need to clarify first the Source code distribution policy in order to be able to specify the testing procedure.
If for example the constraints said about an open-source scheme , then the testers will be the open-source community , 
but if a closed-soyrce scheme is choosen , then our company will need to hire testers , witch will affect the price of the final product

Lastly , a very strong relationship exists between the Network constraints(if any) and maintainance issues. 
If we choose to create an online game , who will be responsible for the maintainance of the infrastucture ?
if the open source scheme is choosen , who will be responsible for maintain the infastructure? Us? The community?

Based on that facts , we can create a diagram as follows

![Diagram No4](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/SoftwareEngineering_2018-19/Group-1/coursework1/raw/f16242b23271f5b3c92a418bdd9073772773030a/que4/D.png)

As we previously said , the ordering of clarification of each level is irrelevant . So we have the technical order as follows

    1. Level 1
        1. Speed
        2. Source Code Distribution Policy
    2. Level 2
        1. Network
        2. Testing
    3. Level 3 
        1. Maintenance
